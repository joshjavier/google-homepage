# Project: Google Homepage

A mini-project where I build the Google homepage from scratch to practice HTML and CSS basics.

This is part of the [Foundations](https://theodinproject.com/courses/foundations) course in [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Notes about the project

I built a [simple copy of the Google homepage](https://joshjavier.github.io/google-homepage/)!

No interactivity or media queries, just plain HTML and CSS with some hover effects.

Many of the concepts were familiar to me (I previously went through freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/joshjavier/responsive-web-design)) but I haven't practiced them for a while, so I had difficulty figuring out how to structure the code to make the HTML and CSS work together.

Some observations:
- I tend to spend time trying to follow best practices, like using `row` and `container` utility classes. I realized that for small projects like this, it's faster to **make it work first**, then if you have time later, go back and refactor as you like.

- This is the first project where I actively used git for incremental commits. The game analogy of "saving my progress in a checkpoint" definitely helped reinforce this habit. Another positive effect is that it helped me divide my work into smaller, more focused chunks -- around what would fit in a git commit message. This made working on the project feel less overwhelming, and led to me taking breaks instead of hopelessly hammering at a roadblock when my brain is already tired.

- I think some parts could have been better implemented with CSS Grid, but I need more practice...
